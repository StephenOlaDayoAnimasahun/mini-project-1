# mini-project-1
School management system
This is a Node.js application that defines an Express server with a few routes to handle HTTP requests. It uses MongoDB for data storage and the mongoose library to interact with the database.

The code defines an Express app and a router, which handles two endpoints: /find-student/:id and /register.

The /find-student/:id endpoint is a GET request that searches for a student in the MongoDB database based on their ID. It uses mongoose to connect to the database and the Student model to query the data. If a student with the provided ID is found, the response includes a success field set to true and the student data. Otherwise, the response includes a success field set to false and an error message.

The /register endpoint is a POST request that creates a new student record in the MongoDB database. It uses the Student model to create a new document and save it to the database. If a student with the provided ID already exists in the database, the response includes a success field set to false and an error message. Otherwise, the response includes a success field set to true and the saved student data.

The code also uses the body-parser library to parse incoming request bodies, the cors library to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and the serverless-http library to wrap the Express app as a handler for serverless environments like Netlify.

Note that the connectToMongoDB() function is commented out, so the app won't establish a database connection when it's started. Instead, it connects to the database in each request handler, which is not an optimal approach for performance reasons. It's recommended to establish a database connection when the app starts up and reuse the connection for subsequent requests.
